          <h1>Gone Home Play Log</h1>

          <p>By John Douglas</p>

          <h3>Home Alone...</h3>

          <p>Gone Home is an exploration walking simulator with a unique spin on the traditional video game format. There are no enemies to defeat or bosses to conquer, no temples or dungeons to delve into, and no loot to be acquired. 
            It is a simple storytelling game that immerses the player in a rich narrative as they walk in the footsteps of Kaitlin Greenbriar, the eldest daughter of the Greenbriar family (See Figure 1). 
            At the start of the game, Kaitlin returns from a year-long adventure in Europe and returns to the mansion that her family had only recently inherited. Upon arrival, Kaitlin is met with an empty home with no one to come and greet her. 
            The game revolves around the player, Kaitlin, uncovering the mystery of the Greenbriar family's whereabouts and learning why the home is vacant.

          <h3>A Foreboding Atmosphere</h3>

          <p>
            The atmosphere of Gone Home is unlike most traditional games. The player gets an eerie sensation as they enter the empty mansion while a thunderstorm roars outside. 
            The house is silent, other than the creaks of the wood and the cracks of the thunder. 
            The mansion would best be described as a "sinuous, spreading labyrinth that...encompass[es] the past and the future" (Garden of Forking Paths, 23). 
            The rooms, connected by long hallways, echo the past of the mid-90s in their layouts and furnishings, and the clues point to the future of Kaitlin knowing what happened to her family (See Figure 2). 
            The atmosphere was uncomfortable for me because while the player is technically alone in the mansion, there is an unshakable, uncanny sense of an unidentifiable presence. 
            As Marty Sliva of IGN puts it, “Despite an ever-present sense of dread – lights flicker sporadically, a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and the house itself seems to moan at times – there's nothing to fear in Gone Home. 
            The only skeletons here are figurative” (Sliva, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review">Gone Home Review</a>). This subtle tension reinforces the player’s curiosity while keeping them slightly on edge.
