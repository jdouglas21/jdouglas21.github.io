          <h1>Gone Home Play Log</h1>
          <h2>By John Douglas</h2>

          <h3>Home Alone...</h3>

          <p>Gone Home is an exploration walking simulator with a unique spin on the traditional video game format. There are no enemies to defeat or bosses to conquer, no temples or dungeons to delve into, and no loot to be acquired. 
            It is a simple storytelling game that immerses the player in a rich narrative as they walk in the footsteps of Kaitlin Greenbriar, the eldest daughter of the Greenbriar family (See Figure 1). 
            At the start of the game, Kaitlin returns from a year-long adventure in Europe and returns to the mansion that her family had only recently inherited. Upon arrival, Kaitlin is met with an empty home with no one to come and greet her. 
            The game revolves around the player, Kaitlin, uncovering the mystery of the Greenbriar family's whereabouts and learning why the home is vacant.
