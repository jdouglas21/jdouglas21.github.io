          <h1>Gone Home Play Log</h1>

          <p>By John Douglas</p>

          <h3>Home Alone...</h3>

          <p>Gone Home is an exploration walking simulator with a unique spin on the traditional video game format. There are no enemies to defeat or bosses to conquer, no temples or dungeons to delve into, and no loot to be acquired. 
            It is a simple storytelling game that immerses the player in a rich narrative as they walk in the footsteps of Kaitlin Greenbriar, the eldest daughter of the Greenbriar family (See Figure 1). 
            At the start of the game, Kaitlin returns from a year-long adventure in Europe and to the mansion that her family had only recently inherited. Upon arrival, Kaitlin is met with an empty home with no one to come and greet her. 
            The game revolves around the player, Kaitlin, uncovering the mystery of the Greenbriar family's whereabouts and learning why the home is vacant.

          <h3>A Foreboding Atmosphere</h3>

          <p>
            The atmosphere of Gone Home is unlike most traditional games. The player gets an eerie sensation as they enter the empty mansion while a thunderstorm roars outside. 
            The house is silent, other than the creaks of the wood and the cracks of the thunder. 
            The mansion would best be described as a "sinuous, spreading labyrinth that...encompass[es] the past and the future" (Garden of Forking Paths, 23). 
            The rooms, connected by long hallways, echo the past of the mid-90s in their layouts and furnishings, and the clues point to the future of Kaitlin knowing what happened to her family (See Figure 2). 
            The atmosphere was uncomfortable for me because while the player is technically alone in the mansion, there is an unshakable, uncanny sense of an unidentifiable presence. 
            As Marty Sliva of IGN puts it, “Despite an ever-present sense of dread – lights flicker sporadically, a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and the house itself seems to moan at times – there's nothing to fear in Gone Home. 
            The only skeletons here are figurative” (Sliva, <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review">Gone Home Review</a>). This subtle tension reinforces the player’s curiosity while keeping them slightly on edge.

          <h3>Wicked Simple Gameplay</h3>

          <p>
            Psychologically, Gone Home makes the player feel uncertain about the best course of action. Because of this, the "operational rules" of the game are immensely limited in function (Rules of Play, 147). 
            Players can only walk, crouch, and pick up objects for inspection (See Figure 3). 
            This limitation of options helps the player be less overwhelmed with mechanics and focus more on the exploration and the narrative they are trying to piece together about the Greenbriar family. 
            The player is given agency over how they wish to explore the mansion and are only limited when there is a locked or hidden entrance to a new section. 
            This simplicity of gameplay allows the player to have "meaningful experiences" that are thought-provoking long after completing the game (Rules of Play, 33).
          </p>

          </figure>


           <h3>Getting Around</h3>

          <p>
            The visual interface of the game is considerably minimal, with no HUD outside of a small crosshair that can be disabled in the settings. 
            There is an inventory menu, a map, and journal entries the player can look at, which help the player if they feel lost (See Figure 4). 
            Because of how significant a role orienteering plays in this game, the developers needed to have players focus on exploration and associated rewards instead of a hefty focus on mechanics. 
            This is accomplished with flying colors as each room holds something of value for the player to take note of, like combinations to locked safes and hints to where players should go next.

          </figure>


          <h3>Where is my family?</h3>

          <p>
            The narrative of the game only evolves with the player's decision-making. This makes for a personalized experience for every player and can sometimes even result in players having different interpretations of the story altogether. 
            The environmental storytelling slowly reveals to Kaitlin the story of the home and the whereabouts of her family through signs (See Figure 5) like personal notes, journals, cassette tapes, school reports, brochures, and letters from Kaitlin's younger sister, Samantha (Rules of Play, 47). 
            The story mainly follows the impactful experiences of Samantha and her transition from moving to a new high school and, soon after, to college. It explores an array of themes like isolation, love, homosexuality, acceptance, and family dynamics.

          <h3>Endgame</h3>

          <p>
            Gone Home is an impressive accomplishment of Fullbright that is more than worthy of its awards. 
            The game is packed with subtle yet rich storytelling, leading players to want to play it multiple times. 
            With an art style that is simple yet beautifully colored, a fantastic score that evolves with the discovery of cassette tapes, and complex themes that young adults explore, the game leaves a lasting impression on many players after completion. 
            Published in 2013, Gone Home was an innovative creation that challenged the traditional gaming format. It will be exciting to see what this cutting-edge game design company will have in store for gamers in the future.

          <h1>Monster Hunter Wilds and A Hunter’s Responsibility</h1>

          <p>By John Douglas</p>

          <h3>A Monumental Launch</h3>

          <p>Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest entry in Capcom’s long-running franchise, launched on February 27, 2025, to critical acclaim, selling an impressive 8 million copies within the first three days. 
            While the game retains the core mechanics that fans love, it introduces a deeper sense of responsibility and morality in hunting, a shift that author Lewis Gordon and many players have noticed.
          </p>

            <figcaption><strong>Lewis Gordon, New York Times, <a class="article-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/arts/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom.html">Article Link</a></strong></figcaption>
            <img src="monster_hunter_1.png" alt="monster_hunter_1" />
          </figure>

          <h3>A Shift in Perspective on Hunting</h3>

          <p>
            Unlike previous entries, Wilds encourages players to reflect on their role as hunters. Where past games focused on combat and resource gathering, Wilds presents hunting as a regulated act, overseen by Alma, the player’s research assistant. 
            Before each hunt, Alma grants permission on behalf of the guild, reinforcing the idea that these hunts have a purpose beyond simple reward-seeking. 
            This seemingly small change subtly shifts the player’s perspective, adding weight to the act of taking a creature’s life.
          </p>

          <h3>A World Alive with Detail</h3>

          <p>
            Beyond the mechanics, Wilds also urges players to slow down and appreciate the world. The campaign frequently prompts moments of environmental observation, allowing players to witness the intricate ecosystems at play. 
            This focus on immersion and ecological depth makes the world feel more alive than ever. Players, during their exploration, can witness changes in the environment, a day-night cycle, and even monsters hunting smaller creatures. 
            The game puts a great amount of effort into showing the players just how alive this ecosystem the developers created is. Some monsters only appear during certain weather conditions, and some can be affected by the environment they are in. 
            For example, the monster Rey Dau can fire lightning as an attack. This can be amplified if it is in its cave, where there are reflective crystals that fire lightning around the cave. 
          </p>

          <h3>Personal Reflections on the Tone Shift</h3>

          <p>
            Speaking from personal experience, this shift in tone was immediately noticeable. In Monster Hunter World, I viewed hunts purely as a means to an end. In other words, you hunt monsters for progressively better gear, rewards, and bragging rights. 
            Monster Hunter Wilds, however, introduced characters like Nata, who made me pause and consider the creatures I was fighting. 
            Nata is a boy from a village that was destroyed by the apex predator of Wilds, and part of the adventure is finding out why the monster destroyed his village. 
            Along the way, we learn more and more about why these monsters behave the way they do, providing a newfound appreciation for the ecosystem created by the developers. 
            This newfound awareness adds an emotional layer to the game, making each hunt feel like part of a larger, living world rather than just another battle.
          </p>

          <h3>The Ethics of the Hunt</h3>

          <p>
            As Lewis Gordon points out, the developers wanted players to feel a sense of duty with every hunt. The introduction of the guild’s licensing system plays a crucial role in this shift, changing the context of the player’s actions. 
            Instead of mindlessly hunting for materials, players must now consider whether a monster poses a threat to people or disrupts the ecosystem. 
            This added layer of accountability deepens the moral complexity of the world, making each encounter more than just a test of skill. 
            It’s a significant evolution for the Monster Hunter series, and hopefully, future games will continue to expand on these themes, further blurring the line between necessity and responsibility in the hunt.

          <h1>Monster Hunter Wilds and A Hunter’s Responsibility</h1>

          <p>By John Douglas</p>

            <figcaption><strong>Darryn Bonthuys, Game Spot, <a class="article-link" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legal-issue-preventing-vampire-survivors-from-getting-cross-save-on-playstation-consoles/1100-6530692/">Article Link</a></strong></figcaption>

          <h3>Developer Transparency on Cross-Save Issues</h3>

          <p>
            In the article written by Darryn Bonthuys on Gamespot, Bonthuys discusses the recent difficulty for Vampire Survivors to obtain a cross-saving function on the Playstation Platform. 
            The developers describe it in their post as “a legal issue on PlayStation we weren't aware of, that requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to” (Bonthuys, Darryn). 
            Because of this legal issue the developers face, they announced that they would be unable to provide the cross-save feature for Playstation 4 and 5 users. 
            This was announced in an impressively heartfelt post where the developers expressed their deepest apologies for such an inconvenience. 
            To me, this level of transparency from a group of developers is much appreciated and should be a more common practice in the industry. 
          </p>

          <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>

          <p>
            From my experiences of playing video games and partaking in video game communities, a somewhat common occurrence is developers not being entirely transparent with their community. 
            They will either hide important information from the players, be completely radio silent, or not tell the whole story. 
            This can cause a lot of distress for video game communities as these players desperately want to know what is in store for the game they are playing. 
            The players put a lot of trust in the developers to keep the game fresh and healthy as it goes on. This is a natural consequence of the ever-popular live service model that has been created in the recent decade. 
            Because of this, I think it is impressive that the Vampire Survivors developers are so honest with their community. This level of transparency is refreshing and can cultivate a loyal fan base.  
            It is especially valuable given the fact that they have so many fans of the game, myself included. 
          </p>

          <h3>Looking Ahead to the Big Update</h3>

          <p>
            This update has been announced to be Vampire Survivors’ biggest update yet. With any big video game update, it makes me wonder just how extensive the update will be. 
            For me, I believe that we can expect new characters, maps, and possibly even new soundtracks. 
            They have had previous large updates and DLCs, such as Ode to Castelvania, which greatly expanded the character roster for the game with all of the iconic Castlevania characters and their weapons of choice. 
            Vampire Survivors has had a big cultural impact on the industry despite how small in scale the game may seem. Many games try to give homage to it and are designed in likeness to its gameplay. 
            The game even got to have a major collaboration with Balatro, a game that recently earned the title of Game of the Year. 
          </p>

          <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

          <p>
            Overall, I think the article written by Bonthuys does a great job at emphasizing the importance of transparency in these video game communities. 
            The developers are hard at work to try and give Playstation players the premium Vampire Survivors experience, and that is a greatly admirable feat. 
            Ensuring the quality of a player’s experience is the top priority of any game development company, and the developer Poncle has made that clear. 
            Hopefully, in the future, other developers can take inspiration from this level of transparency and quality assurance to strive to do the same with their games and communities.
