          <h1>Gone Home Play Log</h1>

          <p>By John Douglas</p>

          <h3>Home Alone...</h3>

          <p>Gone Home is an exploration walking simulator with a unique spin on the traditional video game format. There are no enemies to defeat or bosses to conquer, no temples or dungeons to delve into, and no loot to be acquired. 
            It is a simple storytelling game that immerses the player in a rich narrative as they walk in the footsteps of Kaitlin Greenbriar, the eldest daughter of the Greenbriar family (See Figure 1). 
            At the start of the game, Kaitlin returns from a year-long adventure in Europe and returns to the mansion that her family had only recently inherited. Upon arrival, Kaitlin is met with an empty home with no one to come and greet her. 
            The game revolves around the player, Kaitlin, uncovering the mystery of the Greenbriar family's whereabouts and learning why the home is vacant.

          <h3>A Foreboding Atmosphere</h3>

          <p>
            The atmosphere of Gone Home is unlike most traditional games. The player gets an eerie sensation as they enter the empty mansion while a thunderstorm roars outside. 
            The house is silent, other than the creaks of the wood and the cracks of the thunder. 
            The mansion would best be described as a "sinuous, spreading labyrinth that...encompass[es] the past and the future" (Garden of Forking Paths, 23). 
            The rooms, connected by long hallways, echo the past of the mid-90s in their layouts and furnishings, and the clues point to the future of Kaitlin knowing what happened to her family (See Figure 2). 
            The atmosphere was uncomfortable for me because while the player is technically alone in the mansion, there is an unshakable, uncanny sense of an unidentifiable presence. 
            As Marty Sliva of IGN puts it, “Despite an ever-present sense of dread – lights flicker sporadically, a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and the house itself seems to moan at times – there's nothing to fear in Gone Home. 
            The only skeletons here are figurative” (Sliva, <a class="article-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review">Gone Home Review</a>). This subtle tension reinforces the player’s curiosity while keeping them slightly on edge.

          <h3>Wicked Simple Gameplay</h3>

          <p>
            Psychologically, Gone Home makes the player feel uncertain about the best course of action. Because of this, the "operational rules" of the game are immensely limited in function (Rules of Play, 147). 
            Players can only walk, crouch, and pick up objects for inspection (See Figure 3). 
            This limitation of options helps the player be less overwhelmed with mechanics and focus more on the exploration and the narrative they are trying to piece together about the Greenbriar family. 
            The player is given agency over how they wish to explore the mansion and are only limited when there is a locked or hidden entrance to a new section. 
            This simplicity of gameplay allows the player to have "meaningful experiences" that are thought-provoking long after completing the game (Rules of Play, 33).

           <h3>Getting Around</h3>

          <p>
            The visual interface of the game is considerably minimal, with no HUD outside of a small crosshair that can be disabled in the settings. 
            There is an inventory menu, a map, and journal entries the player can look at, which help the player if they feel lost (See Figure 4). 
            Because of how significant a role orienteering plays in this game, the developers needed to have players focus on exploration and associated rewards instead of a hefty focus on mechanics. 
            This is accomplished with flying colors as each room holds something of value for the player to take note of, like combinations to locked safes and hints to where players should go next.

          <h3>Where is my family?</h3>

          <p>
            The narrative of the game only evolves with the player's decision-making. This makes for a personalized experience for every player and can sometimes even result in players having different interpretations of the story altogether. 
            The environmental storytelling slowly reveals to Kaitlin the story of the home and the whereabouts of her family through signs (See Figure 5) like personal notes, journals, cassette tapes, school reports, brochures, and letters from Kaitlin's younger sister, Samantha (Rules of Play, 47). 
            The story mainly follows the impactful experiences of Samantha and her transition from moving to a new high school and, soon after, to college. It explores an array of themes like isolation, love, homosexuality, acceptance, and family dynamics.

          <h3>Endgame</h3>

          <p>
            Gone Home is an impressive accomplishment of Fullbright that is more than worthy of its awards. 
            The game is packed with subtle yet rich storytelling, leading players to want to play it multiple times. 
            With an art style that is simple yet beautifully colored, a fantastic score that evolves with the discovery of cassette tapes, and complex themes that young adults explore, the game leaves a lasting impression on many players after completion. 
            Published in 2013, Gone Home was an innovative creation that challenged the traditional gaming format. It will be exciting to see what this cutting-edge game design company will have in store for gamers in the future.
