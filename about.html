        <p class="about-text">Hello and welcome to my page! My name is John Douglas and I am a Senior at Pennsylvania State University majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development with a focus in Game Development. 
          This page demonstrates my experiences in the Human-Centered Design field as well as Game Development. 
          I am most experienced in UI/UX design with my primary languages being Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a working knowledge of C# in Unity and some experience with Unreal Engine 5. 
          I hope to use the skills I have honed over the course of this program to contribute to the game industry from the perspective of the user.
